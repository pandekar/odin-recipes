    <h1>Macaroni Salad</h1>
    <img src="macaroniSalad.webp" />
    <p>
        Macaroni noodles hold a special place in my heart. I’m in love with mac and cheese and my<br>
        Mom always served elbows with rouladen gravy and of course this classic macaroni salad.<br>  I
        think the best macaroni salad recipe is a simple side that’s tasty, filling, and budget-friendly. It<br>
        goes with everything from burgers to fried chicken.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>
        Ingredients in macaroni salad include elbows (or ditalini), a creamy dressing, and some add-ins<br>
        for flavor and texture. For the best macaroni salad, use a variety of add-ins with different<br>
        textures and colors.<br>

        Here are a few things I like to add to Macaroni Salad:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fresh & Crisp</strong> – celery, shredded carrots, red bell peppers, fresh parsley, or fresh dill</li>
        <li><strong>Salty</strong> – Try adding cheese, bacon, ham, sliced olives, or even capers.</li>
        <li><strong>Savory</strong>– Green or red onions, dill pickles, garlic powder, boiled eggs, chopped or shredded cheddar.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweet</strong>– Baby peas, pineapple, sweet bell peppers, sweet pickles, or extra pickle relish.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Macaroni Salad Dressing</h2>
    <p>
        This macaroni salad dressing is a very simple mayonnaise-based dressing and takes just a<br>
        couple of minutes to prepare.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mayonnaise</strong> (or dressing) is the base of this dressing recipe. To lighten up the dressing you<br>
            can substitute half of the mayonnaise for Greek yogurt.</li>
        <li><strong>White vinegar</strong> or cider vinegar add tang. Swap for dill pickle juice if you’d like.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweet pickle relish</strong>and a pinch of sugar add sweetness to balance the vinegar. Sugar<br>
            substitutes work well in this recipe or swap sugar for a splash of sweet pickle juice.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings</strong> are kept simple with a touch of prepared or dijon mustard, salt & pepper to taste.</li>
    </ul>
