    <p>
        Lasagna is a type of pasta also known as <i>lasagne</i>, possibly one of the oldest types,<br>
        made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats<br>
        and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as<br>
        garlic, oregano and basil.[3] The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other<br>
        ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square portions.
