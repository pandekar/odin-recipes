    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>
        Keep the basics like cream of chicken soup and the meat, but feel free to substitute the add<br>
        -ins depending on what you have on hand!
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><i>Pasta</i></strong> – Try substituting any medium pasta like fusilli, penne, or even tortellini for the egg noodles.</li>
        <li><strong><i>Chicken</i></strong> – I use either rotisserie or leftover cooked chicken in used in this recipe. Try<br>
                                                substituting diced ham or leftover turkey for a new dish.</li>
        <li><strong><i>Veggies</i></strong>– Add any frozen veggies to the mix. Frozen peas, carrots, or broccoli all are great choices.</li>
        <li><strong><i>Sauce</i></strong>– To keep this meal quick, the sauce is made with cream of chicken soup but I have<br>
                                                included a “from scratch” version in the notes of the recipe too.</li>
        <li><strong><i>Variations</i></strong>– Shredded mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar cheese adds a new flavor twist!<br>
            For some extra kick try adding Monterey or pepper jack. Try using crushed ritz crackers<br>
            instead of panko bread crumbs in the topping.</li>
